Welcome to my OpenGL Learning Log repository! Here, I'm chronicling my journey of diving headfirst into the mesmerizing world of OpenGL. From the very first lines of code to the more intricate shaders and rendering techniques, this repository captures every stumble, breakthrough, and "aha!" moment along the way. Consider this space a peek into the messy, exhilarating process of learning OpenGL – no filters, no sugar-coating, just raw, unfiltered progress.

Join me as I navigate the twists and turns of understanding vertices, shaders, textures, and everything in between. Each commit represents a chapter in my learning story, from the initial confusion to the eventual clarity. Whether you're a fellow enthusiast looking for solidarity in the learning journey or a seasoned veteran curious about the fresh perspective of a newcomer, this repository is an open book of my experiences, mistakes, and triumphs. So, buckle up, grab your favorite beverage, and let's embark on this adventure together – because in the world of OpenGL, every step forward is a victory worth celebrating!
